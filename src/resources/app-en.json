    "helpContent": "<0>Quick Start</0> <1>To create an Activity assignment, select one or multiple Activities from the list, followed by the Participants that should complete those Activities (ie. Respondents). Once complete, your Participants will only see the assessments that are specifically assigned to them (ie. where they are the Respondent), ensuring they focus on what's relevant.</1><2>Please note that, by default, assignments will set to Self-Report. If you would like to create a Multi-Informant Activity assignment, simply add a second Participant (ie. the Subject of the Activity) to the right-hand column of the table under “Who is this activity about?”.</2><3>Activities</3> <4>Please note that Activities or Flows where the ‘Auto-assign’ checkbox is selected (within the Applet Builder) will appear in this list as disabled, and therefore cannot be assigned. To make an Activity assignable, simply exit this flow and go back to your ‘Dashboard’, navigate to ‘Edit Applet’ from the 3-dot menu of the Applet, navigate to the ‘Activities’ tab, select the Activity you’d like to manually assign, and deselect the ‘Auto-assign’ checkbox from within the ‘About Activity’ tab. Click ‘Save & Publish’ to save your changes and return to this assignment flow to create your new assignment. To make a Flow assignable you’ll follow similar steps, except you’ll need to navigate to the ‘Activity Flow’ tab, followed by the Activity Flow you’d like to manually assign (rather than the ‘Activities’ tab).</4> <5>Add Respondents</5> <6>To add a Respondent, click a cell in the left-hand column of the table, and search for your desired Participant (Full Accounts only) or Team Member. By default, the right-hand column will populate with ‘Self’, this default behaviour is a shortcut to creating Self-Reports. You can leave it as is or modify it for other assignment configurations.</6><7>In order to create Multi-Informant assignments, after adding a Respondent to the left-hand column, click into the right-hand column to add a second Participant (Full or Limited Accounts) or Team Member to be the Subject of the Activity. In Multi-Informant assignments the Participant in the left-hand column (ie. the Respondent) will be assigned to complete the Activities selected on behalf of/about the Participant in the right-hand column (ie. the Subject). Meaning that the Participant in the right-hand column will not be assigned to complete the Activities. To add more rows to the table, simply hover over the table to reveal the ‘Add row’ button to the bottom-left.</7><8>Please note that Limited Accounts are restricted to the right-hand column. This is because Limited Accounts can only be Subjects, not Respondents based on the parameters of Limited Accounts in MindLogger. Therefore, all Limited Accounts require you to add a Full Account or Team Member as the Activity’s Respondent before you can continue.</8><9>Review & Send</9> <10>Once you’ve made your selections, you will have a chance to review. Once assignments are sent, all Respondents (ie. Participants listed in the left-hand column) will be sent an email notifying them that they have been assigned a new Activity.</10>",
